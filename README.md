# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets related to vaccination.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project is located in the file "vaccination_all_tweets.csv." It contains tweets related to vaccination.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in sentiment analysis. In this project, we perform the following preprocessing steps on the text data:

- Convert text to lowercase
- Remove URLs
- Remove special characters and symbols
- Tokenize the text
- Remove stop words
- Apply stemming

## Model Development

The sentiment analysis model in this project is developed using various Python libraries, including NLTK, TextBlob, and scikit-learn. The model is trained to classify text data into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

## Training the Model

We train the sentiment analysis model using different machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and accuracy is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

## Evaluation

We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify sentiment.

## Usage

To use the trained sentiment analysis model, you can input your own text and the code will provide you with the sentiment classification (positive, negative, or neutral).

```python
text = input("Enter your Review: ")
text_pp = data_preprocessing(text)
text_stem = stemming(text_pp)
pol_text = polarity(text_stem)
resultant_sentiment = sentiment(pol_text)
print("REVIEW ENTERED: \n", text)
print("Sentiment is: ", resultant_sentiment)
```

## Sample Sentiment Analysis

In the project code, we provide sample sentiment analysis for tweets related to vaccination. The code displays word clouds for the most frequent words in positive, negative, and neutral tweets.
